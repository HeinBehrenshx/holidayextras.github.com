2. From an editorial aspect (check for typos')

To get your work reviewed, please either put in a PR if you are tecnically minded or post the title of the blog post in the general chat on slack.

### Reviewing a blog post
You can reivew a blog post in 2 ways

1. Prose

* Read and review the blog post, send any changes back to the author directly (on slack or other medium)
* Once you are happy and it has been reviewed by two different people you can click 'draft to post'

2. Github

Just like any normal dev work, you can review a PR, comment on the content or editorial parts of the blog post and publish when we have 2 x :+1:'s

## Technical
### Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator - No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install â€” just your content.
It uses HTML files for sturcture and Markdown files for content.

#### To Install
```ruby
gem install jekyll
```

#### To Run
```
jekyll serve
```
The Holiday Extras blog should now be running on your machine at http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/
